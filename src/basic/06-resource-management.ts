// Often in programming we have resources that are 'scoped' to some lifetime
// They often have an explicit 'acquire' and 'release' phase
// Recently typescript introduced the 'using' keyword to help with this
// But its limited as you dont have very fine control over the lifetime of the resource
// it always releases at the end of the block

// Effect has a way to manage resources in a more fine grained way with the `Scope` type

// Think of a `Scope` as a array of effects that run when the scope is closed
// unlike basically everything else in effect, scopes are mutable!
// but it makes sense, because we have to be able to add to them after the scope is created

// Effect has many higher level abstractions for managing resources
// For resources that only have a 'release' phase, we can use `addFinalizer`

// notice the error though, the 'scope' is present as a service requirement
// Effect.runSync(two);

// what this represents is where the scope it to be closed
// when we 'provide' a scope service, we are defining the lifetime of the scope
// the most common way to do this is with `Effect.scoped`
